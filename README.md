# RT-Trainer Next
This project is a total overhaul of RT-Trainer using React/Next.js instead of Svelte/SvelteKit, and Mapbox instead of Leaflet.js. It also aims to add new functionality including an improved route planner and scenario generator, along with improved radio call parsing and feedback.

## Installation and how to run
